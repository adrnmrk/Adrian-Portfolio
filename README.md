## Major Incident Management SOP

The Major Incident Management SOP establishes a standard procedure for reporting, managing, and resolving major outages for a company. This SOP details the escalation process, from initial detection through automated alerts or customer-created high-priority tickets. The document emphasizes ITIL-based practices and clear triage requirements based on incident impact and severity. SLAs in the doc specify response and recovery time, including a post-mortem analysis that will be shared to the affected customers.
